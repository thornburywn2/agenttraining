## ⏳ What's NOT Implemented (From Original TODO.md)

**Important:** The TODO.md file represents the **original vision** for a full-stack application with database, authentication, and API endpoints. The **actual implementation** is a **single-page educational training portal** focused on teaching AGENTS.md concepts.

**Not Applicable to Current Project:**
- ❌ Database setup (PostgreSQL/Prisma configured but not actively used)
- ❌ Authentication system (JWT, user accounts)
- ❌ API endpoints (CRUD operations, user management)
- ❌ Comprehensive testing suite (unit/integration tests)
- ❌ ESLint/Prettier configuration (partially configured)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ❌ Environment-specific deployments

**Why Not Implemented:**
The project evolved into a **training portal** rather than a full-stack application. The focus is on **educational content delivery** through a beautiful, accessible interface - not on backend functionality.
